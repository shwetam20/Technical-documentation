              HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
              and JavaScript are the languages that run the web. They’re very
              closely related, but they’re also designed for very specific
              tasks. Understanding how they interact will go a long way towards
              becoming a web developer. We’ll be expanding on this throughout
              the tutorial, but the gist of it is:

            <ul>
              <li>
                HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.
              </li>
              <li>CSS is for formatting that marked up content.</li>
              <li>
                JavaScript is for making that content and formatting
                interactive.
              </li>
              <li>Flex box is used in HTML to make it more presentable</li>
              <li>
                Media Queries are used in CSS make the content adjust to any
                viewing device

              Add the following HTML markup to our basics.html file. This is
              what you’ll start with for every single web page you’ll ever
              produce. Typically, you would use a templating engine of some sort
              to avoid re-typing the redundant parts, but for this tutorial,
              we’ll be focusing on the raw HTML.

              The “Flexible Box” or “Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative
              to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page.
              Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes,
              flexbox gives us complete control over the alignment, direction,
              order, and size of our boxes.
            </p>
            <code> display: flex;</code>
            <code> flex-direction: columns; </code>

              The “CSS box model“ is a set of rules that define how every web
              page on the Internet is rendered. CSS treats each element in your
              HTML document as a “box” with a bunch of different properties that
              determine where it appears on the page. So far, all of our web
              pages have just been a bunch of elements rendered one after
              another. The box model is our toolkit for customizing this default
              layout scheme.
            </p>
            <code
              >p {padding-top: 20px;} h1 {border: 10px;} .class{margin: 0 auto;}

            <p>
              Media queries always begin with the @media “at-rule” followed by
              some kind of conditional statement, and then some curly braces.
              Inside the curly braces, you put a bunch of ordinary CSS rules.
              The browser only pays attention to those rules if the condition is
              met.
            </p>
            <code>
              @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) { h1 { font-size: 1.2em;

              It is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is
              a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
              example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
              objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
              them.

          <article>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul class="parent-list">
              <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
              <ul class="child-list">
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they
              enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
              Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the
              language. You can think of objects as named containers for values,
              and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

            <p>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
              is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if
              the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
              See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and
              false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
              otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2
              can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have
              multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code
              >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }</code
            >
            <p>
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
              condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
              multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... })
              . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
              especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code
              >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
            >
            <p>
              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
              when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following
              code:
            </p>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p>
              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
              common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
              assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
          </article>
        </div>
        <div class="subject" id="while-stmt">
          <header>while statement</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
              condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
            <p>
              If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
              executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
              executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and
              the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
              execution stops and control is passed to the statement following
              while.
            </p>
            <p>
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
              group those statements.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>
              The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
            </p>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>
              With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to
              x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
              true, so the loop terminates.
